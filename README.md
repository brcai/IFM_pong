# IFM_pong

% neural plasticity is not included here, since the task is relatively simple

play pong game to create neuronal input-output data sample by running pong_neuronal_data.py and neuronal_data_converter.py

run model_training.py to train the state neural network

run model_testing.py to test the trained state neural network

% to do: the computation of individual neurons can be implemented by matrix multiplication to improve efficiency.
